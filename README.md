Rock, paper, scissors game!

This belongs to The Odin Project course that I'm doing at the time of push.

# UPDATES

July 25: I finished styling the page and adding some features. As of now the game won't end when the score is 5, instead it will continue forever.
I'll add this later as I'm making some test now and I'm sure I'll learn some more things in the future which will make this website look cooler.
So yeah, that means I'll come back to this in the future, maybe for my portfolio.
